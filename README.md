# THINKFUL BNB

## What is it?
A web page that was developed using mobile-first development that uses HTML5 features and advanced flex-box techniques.  

## Why?
Provide practical application of mobile-first development techniques using flexbox and relative sizing to supporting varying screen sizes.  

## My Focus
The focus on this exercise was to look at an existing web page mockup that was presented as an image -- then convert it to a fully responsive web page that supports small and desktop form factors.
